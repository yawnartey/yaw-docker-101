what this application will basically do is: 
    - connect to a mongo db docker container which will serve as the database of this application 
    - mongo express is more like a UI to the mongo db




- you can have 2 docker images (mongo & mongo express) communicated with each other
- they are able to do that because they are in the same network
- to do that you can use <docker network> command to create this communitcation
